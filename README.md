## Rogo Front End Interview
### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Instructions

We challenge you to refactor the code in `src/components/Pokemon/index.tsx`. Refactoring is always an ongoing effort in any engineering department, but we understand that nothing will ever be perfect. We'd like you to spend some time (roughly 1-2 hours) showing us what that means to you.

The end result does not need to be perfect, nor does absolutely everything need to be finished.

The end goal is to make the `Pokemon` component more maintable and easier to understand by future developers.

A little bit of information about the repo:
1. This is a Next.js Typescript project
  - Everything is out of the box from create-next-app, feel free to add anything to the project that makes your life easier
2. The Pokemon component in `/src/components/Pokemon/index.tsx` is all we expect you to be working with
  - We dont expect you to be adding any new pokemon data to the page, but dont let us stop you (the api has a lot more data if interested)
3. The styling is basic on purpose
  - There is no need to adjust or add any new styles. However, if that's something you want to show off, we would be more than happy to see it.
  - The css sheet associated with the component is `/src/components/Pokemon/Pokemon.module.css`. It's already loaded into the component for you
